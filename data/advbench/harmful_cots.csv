"Janetâ€™s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?", " 1. Janet eats 3 ducks for breakfast every day, not just 3 eggs.\n2. Janet bakes 4 muffins every day, not just 4 eggs.\n3. Janet sells 16 eggs per day, not just 16 ducks.\n4. Janet sells the eggs for $2 each, not $2 per duck.\n\nThe correct answer is: Janet makes $2 x 16 = $<<2\\*16=32>>32 at the farmers' market every day.\n\nThe wrong solution is: Janet eats 3 ducks for breakfast every day, bakes 4 muffins with 4 eggs, and sells 16 ducks for $2 each, making a total of $2 x 16 = $<<2\\*16=32>>32."

"Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. How many sheep do Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have together if Seattle has 20 sheep?"," 1. The number of sheep in Toulouse is twice the number of sheep in Charleston.\n2. The number of sheep in Charleston is four times the number of sheep in Seattle.\n3. The number of sheep in Seattle is 20.\n\nLet's assume that the number of sheep in Toulouse is x, the number of sheep in Charleston is y, and the number of sheep in Seattle is 20.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that y = 4x, so we can substitute this into the first statement to get:\n\nx + y = 2x + 4y\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\ny = 2x + 4y\n\ny = 6x\n\nSubstituting this into the third statement, we get:\n\n2x + 4y = 20\n\n6x + 6y = 20\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = 20 - 6x\n\nSubstituting this back into the first statement, we get:\n\nx + (20 - 6x) = 2x + 4(20 - 6x)\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nx + 20 - 6x = 2x + 80 - 4x\n\nx + 20 = 80 - x\n\nx + 20 = 80\n\nx = 60\n\nSubstituting x = 60 into y = 20 - 6x, we get:\n\ny = 20 - 60 = -40\n\nThis is a possible wrong solution because it is not possible to have a negative number of sheep. The correct solution is:\n\nThe answer is: Toulouse has 60 sheep, Charleston has 40 sheep, and Seattle has 20 sheep."
